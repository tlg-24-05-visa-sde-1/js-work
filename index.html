        Move from feeling standard to super in the SUPERBLAST™ 2 PARIS shoe.
        It's designed to help provide the most responsive, energized feel
        compared to other shoes in the ASICS® cushioning range.​ This colorway
        is inspired by "the city of lights" and its energizing tones at sunrise
        and sunset. The midsole features a combination of FF BLAST™ PLUS ECO and
        FF TURBO™ PLUS cushioning. Also used in our METASPEED™ racing models,
        this foam helps creates one of the lightest and bounciest running
        experiences.
